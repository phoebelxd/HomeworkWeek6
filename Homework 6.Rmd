This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
{
  setwd("~/HomeworkWeek6")
  mygenes <- read.csv('gene_dist_head.tsv',header = TRUE, sep = "\t",
             quote = "\"", dec = ".", fill = TRUE)
  library('ggplot2')
  library('plotly')
}
```

First, I use `setwd` to change the current working directory to Homework6, which is a local clone of my github repo. I also use `read.csv` to load data into dataframe `mygenes`. However, the separator is tab instead of comma. I use  `library` to load `ggplot2` and `plotly`.

```{r}
{
  mygenessummary <- summary(mygenes)
}
```
Then, I use `summary` to get the summary of dataframe `mygenes`. I also use `<-` to store the summary into another dataframe.

```{r}
{
  autosomes<-c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10",
              "11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22")  
  genes<- mygenes[ which(mygenes$chr %in% autosomes), ] 
  genes$chr <- factor(genes$chr, levels = autosomes) 
  ggplot(data = genes) +  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1)
}
```
Next, I used `autosomes<-c` to define a factor set of autosomes from 1 to 22, then I used `<-` to create a new dataframe called 'genes' which only has autosomes`chr %in% autosomes`. This will select every row where chr is one of the values in autosomes. For removing the factors and ordering them from alphabetical to numerical order, I used `factor` on `genes$chr`, and plotted in ggplot.

```{r}
{
  ggplotly(ggplot(data = genes) +  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1))
}
```
I added `ggplotly` to process the output of `ggplot` in order to make the plot interactive.
